Q.1 Difference between Python version 2 and version 3 ?
Ans: (1). P2 : ==> Xrange() use for loop . , P3: ==> range() use for loop .
(2). P2 : ==> Work on ASCII , P3 : ==> Work on Unicode
(3). P2 : ==> print() not compulsory , P3 : ==> print() compulsory
How do you check current version of python ?
Ans: Go to command prompt => enter => python –version
Q.2 Difference between local variable vs global variable ?examples ?
Ans: Local variable
1. Local variables are defined within a specific function or block.
2. They are only accessible within that function or block.
3. Local variables have a limited scope and are destroyed once the function or block execution is completed.
Eg:
def my_function():
x = 10 # Local variable
print(x)
my_function() # Output: 10
print(x) # Error: x is not defined
Globall variable:
1. Global variables are defined outside any function or block.
2. They can be accessed from any part of the program, including functions or blocks.
3. Global variables have a global scope and can be used throughout the program.
Eg:
x = 10 # Global variable
def my_function():
print(x)
my_function() # Output: 10
print(x) # Output: 10
It's important to note that if a local variable hasthe same name as a global variable, the local variable will take
precedence within its scope. To access the global variable in such cases, you can use the global keyword.
Q.3 What are the data types in python ?
Ans: following are the data type in python:
1. Integer - represents whole numbers, e.g., 1, 10, -5.
2. Float - represents floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 0.0.
3. String - represents a sequence of characters, enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
4. Boolean - represents either True or False.
5. List - represents an ordered collection of elements, enclosed in square brackets ([]).
6. Tuple - represents an ordered, immutable collection of elements, enclosed in parentheses ().
7. Dictionary - represents a collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces ({}) where each key is unique.
Q.4 What is difference between Mutable and Immutable Data types ? How many data types are mutable or
not ?Please provide reason with examples?
Ans: In Python, mutable data types are the ones that can be modified after they are created, while immutable data
types cannot be changed once they are assigned a value.
The mutable data types in Python include lists, sets, and dictionaries. Let's take a look at an example with a list:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list[0] = 5
print(my_list) # Output: [5, 2, 3, 4]
As you can see, the list can be modified by adding elements using append() or by changing the value at a specific
index.
On the other hand, immutable data types in Python include strings, tuples, and frozensets. Here's an example with
strings:
my_string = "Hello"
print(my_string) # Output: Hello
my_string += " World"
print(my_string) # Output: Hello World
# Trying to change a character at a specific index will result in an error
my_string[0] = "J" # Error: 'str' object does not support item assignment
In this case, the string cannot be modified directly, and attempting to change a character at a specific index will result
in a TypeError.
To summarize, the key difference isthat mutable data types allow modifications after creation, while immutable data
types do not. Lists, sets, and dictionaries are mutable, while strings, tuples, and frozensets are immutable.
Q.5 Why we use loops ? Please provide 3 examples of for loop and 3 examples of while loop ?
Ans: Loops are used in programming to repeat a specific block of code multiple times. They are useful when we want
to perform a certain action repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Here are three examples of for loops and three
examples of while loops:
Examples of for loops:
1. Printing numbers from 1 to 10: for i in range(1, 11): print(i)
2. Iterating through a list and performing an action on each element: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"] for
fruit in fruits: print("I like", fruit)
3. Calculating the sum of numbers in a given range: sum = 0 for i in range(1, 6): sum += i print("Sum:", sum)
Examples of while loops:
1. Printing numbers from 1 to 5: i = 1 while i <= 5: print(i) i += 1
2. Asking for user input until a specific condition is met: correct_password = "password123" user_input =
input("Enter password: ") while user_input != correct_password: print("Incorrect password. Try again.")
user_input = input("Enter password: ") print("Access granted!")
3. Finding the first power of 2 that is greater than 100: power = 1 while power <= 100: power *= 2 print("First
power of 2 greater than 100:", power)
Q.6 Why we use functions ? Difference between lambda , filter , reduce , map function with examples ?
Ans:
Functions are used in programming to group a set of instructions together and give them a name, allowing us to
reuse the code and make our programs more modular and organized. They help in breaking down complex tasks into
smaller, manageable parts.
Now, let's discussthe differences between lambda, filter, reduce, and map functions:
Lambda Functions:
1. Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are functions without a name.
2. They are defined inline and are typically used for simple and one-time operations.
3. Lambda functions are defined using the keyword lambda.
Example: double = lambda x: x * 2 result = double(5) print(result) # Output: 10
Filter Function:
1. The filter() function is used to filter out elements from a sequence based on a specific condition.
2. It takes a function and an iterable as arguments and returns an iterator with the elements that satisfy the
condition.
Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)) print(even_numbers)
# Output: [2, 4, 6]
Reduce Function:
1. The reduce() function is used to apply a function to an iterable and reduce it to a single cumulative value.
2. It takes a function and an iterable as arguments and returns a single value.
3. Note: In Python 3, the reduce() function is part of the functools module, so you need to import it before
using.
Example: from functools import reduce numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y,
numbers) print(sum_of_numbers) # Output: 15
Map Function:
1. The map() function is used to apply a function to each element in an iterable and return a new
iterator with the results.
2. It takes a function and an iterable as arguments and returns an iterator with the modified elements.
Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)) print(squared_numbers)
# Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Q.7 Difference between list and tuple ?Please provide index() , insert() , append(), reverse() , pop() explain with
examples ?
Ans:
A list in Python is a mutable data type, meaning you can modify its elements. It is represented by square brackets []
and can store elements of different data types. Here's an example:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
On the other hand, a tuple is an immutable data type, meaning its elements cannot be modified once it is created. It
is represented by parentheses () and can also store elements of different data types. Here's an example:
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
1. index(): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element within the list or tuple.
Example: my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 20] print(my_list.index(20)) # Output: 1
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 20) print(my_tuple.index(20)) # Output: 1 ```
2. insert(): This method inserts an element at a given index within the list. For tuples, since they are immutable,
this operation is not possible.
Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3] my_list.insert(1, 10) print(my_list) # Output: [1, 10, 2, 3] my_tuple = (1, 2,
3) # Tuples cannot be modified ```
3. append(): This method adds an element at the end of the list. Tuples, being immutable, do not have an
append() method.
Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3] my_list.append(4) print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]my_tuple =
(1, 2, 3) # Tuples cannot be modified ```
4. reverse(): This method reversesthe order of elementsin the list. Since tuples are immutable, they do not have
a reverse() method.
Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] my_list.reverse() print(my_list) # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]my_tuple = (1,
2, 3) # Tuples cannot be modified ```
5. pop(): This method removes and returns the element at the specified index within the list. For tuples, as they
are immutable, this operation is not possible.
Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3] removed_element = my_list.pop(1) print(my_list) # Output: [1, 3]
print(removed_element) # Output: 2
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3) # Tuples cannot be modified ```
Q.8 Difference between dictionary vsset ? Please provide keys() , values() ,items() example of dictionary and
union() , intersection() in sets ? Is FrozenSet is mutable or not ?
Ans: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique, whereas a set is a collection of unique
elements with no specific order.
For a dictionary, you can use the keys(), values(), and items() methods to access its keys, values, and key-value pairs,
respectively.
# Dictionary example
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
# Accessing keys
print(my_dict.keys()) # Output: ['name', 'age', 'city']
# Accessing values
print(my_dict.values()) # Output: ['John', 25, 'New York']
# Accessing key-value pairs
print(my_dict.items()) # Output: [('name', 'John'), ('age', 25), ('city', 'New York')]
On the other hand, sets provide various operations such as union() and intersection().
# Set examples
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
# Union of two sets
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
# Intersection of two sets
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection_set) # Output: {3, 4}
Regarding the FrozenSet, it is an immutable variant of the set. It means that once a FrozenSet is created, you cannot
modify its elements. FrozenSets are created using the frozenset() function:
frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
print(frozen_set) # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3})
Q.9 What are decorators ? Please provide example ?
Ans: Decorators in Python are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or classes without changing
their source code. They allow us to add additional functionality to existing functions or classes by wrapping them
with another function.
Eg:
def decorator_function(original_function):
def wrapper_function():
print("Before the function execution")
original_function()
print("After the function execution")
return wrapper_function
@decorator_function
def hello():
print("Hello, world!")
hello()
In this example, we define a decorator function decorator_function that takes an original function as its parameter. It
defines a wrapper function wrapper_function that adds some extra functionality before and after the original
function is executed. The wrapper function is then returned.
The @decorator_function syntax is used to apply the decorator to the hello function. This is equivalent to
writing hello = decorator_function(hello). When we call hello(), it will execute the decorated version of
the hello function, which prints "Before the function execution", then calls the original hello function that prints
"Hello, world!", and finally prints "After the function execution".
Decorators are useful for adding logging, timing, authentication, or other cross-cutting concernsto functions or
classes without modifying their code directly. They provide a way to enhance the functionality of existing code in a
clean and modular manner.
Q.10 What is list comprehension ?Please provide example ?
Ans: List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It allows you to create a new list by applying an
expression to each item in an existing list, along with optional conditional statements. Here's an example:
Let's say we have a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and we want to create a new list that contains the squares of these
numbers. We can use list comprehension to achieve this:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]
In this example, [x**2 for x in numbers] is the list comprehension expression. It iterates over each element x in
the numbers list and squares it (x**2), creating a new list called squares with the squared values.
The resulting squares list will be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].
Q.11 How do you create an array from a user defined list?
Ans: To create an array from a user-defined list in Python, you can use the array module. Here's an example:
import array
# User-defined list
user_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Creating an array from the list
arr = array.array('i', user_list)
# 'i' represents the type code for signed integers
print(arr)
This code snippet will create an array (arr) from a user-defined list (user_list) using the array module in Python. The
type code 'i' represents signed integers in the array.
Q.12 Difference between hstack() vs vstack() with example ?
Ans:
The hstack() and vstack() functions are used for stacking arrays horizontally and vertically, respectively.
hstack() is used to horizontally stack arrays, meaning it concatenates arrays along the horizontal axis. This means that
it combines arrays column-wise. Here's an example:
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
result = np.hstack((a, b))
print(result)
Output: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
vstack() is used to vertically stack arrays, meaning it concatenates arrays along the vertical axis. This meansthat it
combines arrays row-wise. Here's an example:
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
result = np.vstack((a, b))
print(result)
Output: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]
In summary, hstack() combines arrays column-wise, while vstack() combines arraysrow-wise.
Q.13 What is Broadcasting in NumPy ? Please provide an example ?
Ans:
Broadcasting in NumPy refers to the ability of NumPy arrays to perform arithmetic operations on arrays with
different shapes. When performing element-wise operations, NumPy automatically adjusts the shapes of the arrays
to make them compatible. This eliminates the need for explicit looping over the arrays.
import numpy as np
# Creating two NumPy arrays
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
# Performing element-wise addition using broadcasting
result = a + b
print(result)
Output: [5 7 9]
In the example above, the arrays a and b have different shapes, but NumPy automatically broadcasts them to
perform the addition operation. The result is a new array [5, 7, 9], which is the element-wise sum of a and b.
Q.14 What is zeros() , ones() , eye() , diag() , randint() , rand() ,seed(), linspace() , unique() in NumPy ? please
provide explanation with example ?
1. zeros(): This function creates an array filled with zeros.
Example: ```python import numpy as np
arr = np.zeros((2, 3)) print(arr) Output: [[0. 0. 0.] [0. 0. 0.]] ```
2. ones(): This function creates an array filled with ones.
Example: ```python import numpy as np
arr = np.ones((2, 3)) print(arr) Output: [[1. 1. 1.] [1. 1. 1.]] ```
3. eye(): Thisfunction creates an identity matrix, which is a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros
elsewhere.
Example: ```python import numpy as np
arr = np.eye(3) print(arr) Output: [[1. 0. 0.] [0. 1. 0.] [0. 0. 1.]] ```
4. diag(): This function extracts the diagonal from a given array or creates a diagonal array from a given list.
Example: ```python import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) diagonal = np.diag(arr) print(diagonal) Output: [1 5 9] ```
5. randint(): Thisfunction generates random integers within a specified range.
Example: ```python import numpy as np
rand_int = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=(2, 3)) print(rand_int) Output: [[4 6 7] [5 3 2]] ```
6. rand(): This function generates random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.
Example: ```python import numpy as np
rand_num = np.random.rand(2, 3) print(rand_num) Output: [[0.43234262 0.87541347 0.23429295] [0.57263289
0.87640961 0.15698545]] ```
7. seed(): This function is used to set the random seed, allowing reproducibility of random numbers.
Example: ```python import numpy as np
np.random.seed(42) rand_num = np.random.rand(2, 3) print(rand_num) Output: [[0.37454012 0.95071431
0.73199394] [0.59865848 0.15601864 0.15599452]] ```
8. linspace(): Thisfunction generates a linearly spaced array between two specified values.
Example: ```python import numpy as np
arr = np.linspace(1, 5, num=10) print(arr) Output: [1. 1.44444444 1.88888889 2.33333333 2.77777778 3.22222222
3.66666667 4.11111111 4.55555556 5. ] ```
9. unique(): This function returns the unique elements of an array in sorted order.
Example: ```python import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 6, 3, 6]) unique_values = np.unique(arr) print(unique_values) Output: [1 2 3 4 5 6] ```
Q.15 How can you reshape your array in NumPy? What is argmin() and argmax() in NumPy ? Please explain with
example ?
Ans:
To reshape an array in NumPy, you can use the reshape() function. Thisfunction allows you to change the shape
(dimensions) of an array without modifying its data. Here's an example:
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape((2, 3))
print(reshaped_arr)
Output:
[[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]]
In this example, we start with a 1-dimensional array arr and reshape it into a 2-dimensional array with dimensions (2,
3).
The argmin() function returns the indices of the minimum values along a specified axis or in a flattened array.
Similarly, the argmax() function returns the indices of the maximum values. Here's an example to illustrate their
usage:
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([5, 2, 9, 1, 7])
min_index = np.argmin(arr)
max_index = np.argmax(arr)
print("Minimum value:", arr[min_index], "at index:", min_index)
print("Maximum value:", arr[max_index], "at index:", max_index)
Output:
Minimum value: 1 at index: 3
Maximum value: 9 at index: 2
In this example, we have an array arr, and we use argmin() and argmax() functions to find the minimum and
maximum values along the flattened array. We then print the values and their corresponding indices.
Test Series 2
Q.1 What is Pandas ?
Ans:
Pandas is a Python library that provides data manipulation and analysis tools. It offers data structures and functions
to efficiently handle and analyze structured data, such as numerical tables and time series data. It simplifies tasks like
data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and visualization, making it a powerful tool for working with data in Python.
Q.2 Difference between series and dataframe ?
Ans:
In Python, both Series and DataFrame are data structures provided by the pandas library for data manipulation and
analysis.
A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a
dictionary with a key-value pair. Each element in a Series has a unique label called an index.
Here's an example of a Series in Python:
import pandas as pd
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
series = pd.Series(data)
print(series)
Output: 0 10 1 20 2 30 3 40 4 50 dtype: int64
A DataFrame, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different
data types. It can be seen as a table, similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. A DataFrame consists of multiple Series
aligned together.
Here's an example of a DataFrame in Python:
import pandas as pd
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Emily', 'Charlie'],
'Age': [25, 30, 35],
'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Sydney']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
Output: Name Age City 0 John 25 New York 1 Emily 30 London 2 Charlie 35 Sydney
In summary, a Series represents a single column of data, while a DataFrame is a collection of Series arranged in a
tabular form.
Q.3 Difference between loc and iloc ?
Ans:
loc and iloc are two indexing methods used in pandas for selecting data from a DataFrame.
loc is label-based indexing, which means that you can select data based on the row and column labels. You can
provide the row label(s) and column label(s) as arguments to the loc function to access specific data. For example:
import pandas as pd
# Creating a sample DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Emily', 'Michael', 'Jessica'],
'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40],
'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'Tokyo']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Using loc to select data
print(df.loc[1, 'City']) # Output: London
print(df.loc[2:3, 'Name']) # Output:
# 2 Michael
# 3 Jessica
# Name: Name, dtype: object
iloc, on the other hand, is integer-based indexing, which means that you can select data based on the integer
positions of the rows and columns. You can provide the row index(es) and column index(es) as arguments to
the iloc function to access specific data. For example:
import pandas as pd
# Using iloc to select data
print(df.iloc[1, 2]) # Output: London
print(df.iloc[2:3, 0]) # Output:
# 2 Michael
# Name: Name, dtype: object
In summary, loc uses labels to select data, while iloc uses integer positions.
Q.4 what does value_counts() ?
Ans: value_counts() is a function in Python that is used to count the number of occurrences of each unique value in a
Pandas Series or DataFrame column. It returns a new Series containing the counts of each unique value, sorted in
descending order.
import pandas as pd
# Create a Pandas Series
data = pd.Series([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4])
# Use value_counts() to count occurrences of each unique value
counts = data.value_counts()
print(counts)
Output: 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 dtype: int64
In this example, value_counts() counts the occurrences of each unique value in the Series. The number 4 appears 4
times, the number 3 appears 3 times, the number 2 appears 2 times, and the number 1 appears 1 time. The result is
a new Series with the counts, sorted in descending order.
Q.5 how do you handle missing values using pandas ?
Ans:To handle missing values using pandas, you can use various methods. Here's an example:
Let's say you have a DataFrame named "df" with a column called "age" that contains some missing values
represented by NaN. You want to handle those missing values.
1. Drop the missing values: You can remove rows that contain missing values using the dropna() method. For
example: df.dropna(subset=['age'], inplace=True) This will drop all rowsthat have missing values in the "age"
column.
2. Fill missing values with a specific value: You can replace the missing values with a specific value using
the fillna() method. For example, to fill the missing values in the "age" column with the value
0: df['age'].fillna(0, inplace=True) This will replace all missing values in the "age" column with 0.
3. Fill missing values with the mean: You can fill missing values with the mean value of the column using
the fillna() method along with the mean() function. For example: mean_age = df['age'].mean()
df['age'].fillna(mean_age, inplace=True) This will replace the missing values in the "age" column with the
mean value calculated from the existing values.
Q.6 How do you merge 2 tables using pandas ?
Ans: To merge two tables using pandas, you can use the merge() function. This function combines the columns from
two DataFrames based on a common key or keys.
Here's an example:
import pandas as pd
# Creating the first DataFrame
data1 = {'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4],
'Name': ['John', 'Emma', 'Ryan', 'Sophia'],
'Age': [25, 28, 30, 27]}
df1 = pd.DataFrame(data1)
# Creating the second DataFrame
data2 = {'ID': [1, 2, 3, 5],
'Department': ['HR', 'Finance', 'Marketing', 'IT']}
df2 = pd.DataFrame(data2)
# Merging the two DataFrames based on the 'ID' column
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID')
print(merged_df)
Output: ID Name Age Department 0 1 John 25 HR 1 2 Emma 28 Finance 2 3 Ryan 30 Marketing
In this example, we have two DataFrames (df1 and df2) with a common column 'ID'. By using the merge() function
and specifying the 'ID' column as the key, we merge the two DataFrames based on their matching 'ID' values.
Q.7 How do you connect jupyter notebook to mysql ?
Ans:
Use the following syntax to connect jupyter notebook to mysql:
In Jupiter notebook write the following query:
!pip install mysql.connector
import mysql.connector
conn = mysql.connector.connect(host = 'localhost' ,
user = 'root',
password = '',
database = 'database_name’)
import pandas as pd
pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM database_name" , conn)
Q.8 What does group by in pandas ?
Ans: The "group by" function in pandas is used to split a DataFrame into groups based on specified criteria, such as a
column or columns. It allows you to perform operations on these grouped data such as aggregation, transformation,
or filtering.
For example, let'ssay we have a DataFrame containing information about employees:
import pandas as pd
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'John'],
'Department': ['Finance', 'HR', 'Finance', 'IT', 'HR'],
'Salary': [5000, 6000, 5500, 4500, 5500]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
To group the data by the "Department" column and calculate the average salary for each department, we can use the
"group by" function:
grouped_df = df.groupby('Department')
average_salary = grouped_df['Salary'].mean()
The resulting "grouped_df" object is a GroupBy object that represents the grouped data. We can then apply different
aggregation functions, such as "mean", "sum", "count", etc., to obtain the desired results.
In this case, we calculated the average salary for each department by specifying the "Salary" column in the
"grouped_df" object.
Q.9 difference between CrossTab vs Pivot table ?
Ans: CrossTab and Pivot table are two different functions used for data analysisin Python, specifically in pandas
library. They serve similar purposes but have slight differences in functionality.
CrossTab:
• The crosstab() function in pandas is used to compute a cross-tabulation table. It shows the frequency
distribution of variables in a tabular form.
• It takes two or more categorical variables as input and computes a table that displays the relationship
between them.
• The resulting table presents the frequency counts or normalized values of the variables' combinations.
• This function is typically used to analyze the relationship between two categorical variables.
Example: Let's consider a dataset of online retail sales with two categorical variables: 'Country' and
'Product_Category'. We want to analyze the frequency distribution of product categoriesfor each country.
import pandas as pd
data = {
'Country': ['USA', 'USA', 'Canada', 'Canada', 'USA', 'Canada'],
'Product_Category': ['Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Electronics', 'Clothing']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
crosstab_table = pd.crosstab(df['Country'], df['Product_Category'])
print(crosstab_table)
Output: Product_Category Clothing Electronics Country Canada 2 1 USA 1 2
Pivot Table:
• The pivot_table() function in pandas is used to create a pivot table from a given DataFrame.
• It allows us to summarize and aggregate data based on one or more variables, creating a hierarchical table.
• We can specify which variables to use as rows, columns, and values in the resulting pivot table.
• This function is used to analyze numerical or continuous variables based on categorical variables.
Example: Let's consider a dataset of employee records with variables 'Department', 'Gender', and 'Salary'. We want
to calculate the average salary for each department and gender.
import pandas as pd
data = {
'Department': ['HR', 'HR', 'IT', 'IT', 'Finance', 'Finance'],
'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female'],
'Salary': [5000, 6000, 7000, 5500, 8000, 7500]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
pivot_table = pd.pivot_table(df, values='Salary', index='Department', columns='Gender', aggfunc='mean')
print(pivot_table)
Output: Gender Female Male Department Finance 7500 8000 HR 6000 5000 IT 5500 7000
In summary, the crosstab() function is used to analyze the relationship between categorical variables, while
the pivot_table() function is used to summarize numerical data based on categorical variables.
Q.10 In which scenerio what kind of plot you will use ? Numerical ==? , Categorical ==?
Ans:
For numerical data, you can use various types of plots such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histogram plots,
box plots, etc. These plots are useful for visualizing the distribution, trends, relationships, and comparisons within
numerical data.
For categorical data, you can use bar plots, pie charts, count plots, and categorical scatter plots. These plots are
helpful for displaying the frequencies, proportions, and comparisons between different categories.
Q.11 What does TimeDelta in Pandas ?
Ans:
The TimeDelta function in pandas is used to represent a duration or difference between two dates or times. It allows
you to perform arithmetic operations on dates and times. Here's an example to illustrate its usage:
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
# Create two datetime objects
start_time = datetime(2021, 7, 1, 10, 0, 0)
end_time = datetime(2021, 7, 1, 11, 30, 0)
# Calculate the time difference
duration = end_time -start_time
# Create a TimeDelta object using the duration
time_delta = pd.Timedelta(duration)
# Print the time difference
print(time_delta)
Output: 1:30:00
In this example, we calculate the difference between start_time and end_time using the subtraction operator. Then,
we create a TimeDelta object using pd.Timedelta() and store the result in the time_delta variable. Finally, we print
the time difference, which is 1 hour and 30 minutes.
Q.12 How can you extract day , month , year in a date column using pandas ?
Ans: To extract the day, month, and year from a date column using pandas, you can utilize the dt accessor provided
by pandas. Here's an example:
import pandas as pd
# Assuming you have a DataFrame with a date column called 'date_column'
df = pd.DataFrame({'date_column': ['2022-05-10', '2023-01-15', '2024-09-30']})
# Convert the 'date_column' to datetime format
df['date_column'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_column'])
# Extract day, month, and year using dt accessor
df['day'] = df['date_column'].dt.day
df['month'] = df['date_column'].dt.month
df['year'] = df['date_column'].dt.year
# Print the updated DataFrame
print(df)
Output: date_column day month year 0 2022-05-10 10 5 2022 1 2023-01-15 15 1 2023 2 2024-09-30 30 9 2024
In the above example, we convert the 'date_column' to a datetime format using pd.to_datetime(). Then, we use
the dt accessor (e.g., df['date_column'].dt.day) to extract the day, month, and year components into separate
columns 'day', 'month', and 'year', respectively.
Q.13 How can you extract hours , minutes,seconds in a datetime column ?
Ans:
To extract hours, minutes, and seconds from a datetime column in Python using pandas, you can use the dt accessor
provided by pandas. Here's an example:
import pandas as pd
# Create a DataFrame with a datetime column
data = {'date_time': ['2022-01-01 09:30:45', '2022-01-01 10:45:20', '2022-01-01 14:15:30']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Convert the 'date_time' column to datetime type
df['date_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_time'])
# Extract hours, minutes, and seconds using the dt accessor
df['hours'] = df['date_time'].dt.hour
df['minutes'] = df['date_time'].dt.minute
df['seconds'] = df['date_time'].dt.second
print(df)
Output: date_time hours minutes seconds 0 2022-01-01 09:30:45 9 30 45 1 2022-01-01 10:45:20 10 45 20 2 2022-01-
01 14:15:30 14 15 30
In the example above, we first convert the 'date_time' column to datetime type using pd.to_datetime(). Then, we use
the dt accessor to extract the hours, minutes, and seconds into separate columns 'hours', 'minutes', and 'seconds',
respectively.
Q.14 How do you read a excel file , csv file and json file in jupyter notebook using pandas ?
Ans:
1. Reading an Excel file:
import pandas as pd
df_excel = pd.read_excel('path_to_file.xlsx')
2. Reading a CSV file:
import pandas as pd
df_csv = pd.read_csv('path_to_file.csv')
3. Reading a JSON file:
import pandas as pd
df_json = pd.read_json('path_to_file.json')
Q.15 How can you create excel data from a dataframe using pandas ?
Ans:
To create an Excel file from a DataFrame using pandas, you can use the to_excel() function. Here's an example:
import pandas as pd
# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Emily', 'Michael'],
'Age': [25, 28, 32],
'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Save the DataFrame to an Excel file
